### N Queen Problem
#### Problem :- In n dimensional space , we need to adjust queens such that, no two queens are in the same row, same column or diagnal to each other.

### Solution :- 1. Going from 1 to n, check if current queen can be placed in the ith column ---> Then move to next queen and check where it can be placed---> if no place is found, then backtracking happens and again the queens are replaces
